# Roquefield&ensp;ðŸ§€&ensp;[![build](https://github.com/smikhalevski/roquefield/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/smikhalevski/roquefield/actions/workflows/master.yml)

The [1 kB](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=roquefield) field state management library with strict typings that can
handle hundreds of fields per field without breaking a sweat.

```sh
npm install --save-prod roquefield
```

# Motivation

Field lifecycle consists of four separate phases: Input, Validate, Display Errors, and Submit. These phases can be
represented as non-intersecting black boxes. The result obtained during one phase may be used as an input for another
phase:

1. The input value is validated.
2. Validation errors are displayed.
3. Input value is submitted.
4. Validation errors received after a backend validation are displayed.

Since phases are non-intersecting, they should only share the knowledge about data shapes passed between them. This also
allows phases to be run in parallel. The couple of examples:

1. While user proceeds with input, we can asynchronously validate the input and show errors for fields that were not
   updated while validation was pending.
2. We can debounce computation-heavy asynchronous validation or abort it if the input has changed.

The field management solution must be agnostic to validation process, shouldnâ€™t enforce the way errors are displayed, or
restrict how the data submission is handled.

Since data submission is application-specific, and thereâ€™s a great number of awesome validation libraries, we should
focus on streamlining the field input management and error display.

# Usage

```tsx
import {useField, Field} from 'roquefield';

const parentField = useField({foo: {bar: 123}});

<Field initialValue={parentField.at(1).at('foo')}>
  {(field) => (
      <>
        <input
            ref={field.ref}
            value={field.value}
            onChange={(event) => {
              field.setValue(event.target.value);
            }}
            onBlur={() => {
              field.dispatch()
            }}
        />
        <ErrorMessages errors={errors} field={field}/>
      </>
  )}
</Field>
```
